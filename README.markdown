## Coding Cats on Octopress

My silly site to host projects, contact info, and possibly a blog post or two.

## Notes to myself

To generate & preview:

```shell
rake preview    # Watches, and mounts a webserver at http://localhost:4000
```

To make a new post:

```shell
rake new_post['my post title']
```

Edit markup mostly in     `source/_includes/custom/`
Edit styles mostly in     `sass/`
Edit javascript mostly in `source/javascripts/`
