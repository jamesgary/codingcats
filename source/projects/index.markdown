## lifeGL

![screenshot of lifeGL](foo.png)

My goals in this were:

- Simulate Conway's Game of Life in high detail
  - 1 pixel per cell
  - 60 FPS at full screen
- Get my hands dirty with WebGL
- Adjust GoL rules in real time
- Keep codebase simple and maintainable
  - Use Guard, Coffeescript, Sass, and Haml
